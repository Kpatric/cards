RESTful web service Java Spring Boot MySQL

This API demonstrates the use of spring security 6 authentication and authorization.

It also shows how to use spring data jpa to perform basic CRUD operation.

To run this app, open it in your favourite IDE and create a MYSQL schema using the script shared under FILES folder.

The postman collection is also under the files' folder. Import the collection and spin the app.

We are using JWT Bearer token for subsequent authentication after login. 

We also have Swagger documentation under this link. http://localhost:${"your_port"}/swagger-ui/index.html

Enjoy.
